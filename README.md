### Hello ðŸ™‚

My name is Tristan and I'm currently a post-doc at the Integrated Remote Sensing Studio at the University of British Columbia.

My research focuses on enhancing forest inventories using remote sensing data. 

My current focus is on [structurally guided sampling approaches](https://github.com/tgoodbody/sgsR) and the use of lidar data for resource management.
